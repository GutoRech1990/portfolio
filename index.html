                    <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>

                    <p>I'm thrilled to have you here, and I'm excited to share my journey with you. My name is <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">José Augusto Rech</span>, and I'm originally from Luiz Alves, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Born in 1990, I embarked on my academic path at the age of 17, initially pursuing studies in Logistics at the University of Itajaí. However, at the age of 20, I was fortunate to receive a scholarship that led me to switch gears and dive into the captivating world of Accounting at Uniasselvi University.</p>
                    
                    <p>For the next decade, I resided in the beautiful city of Blumenau, immersing myself in the intricacies of accounting principles, financial analysis, and business management. These years of learning and professional experience shaped my understanding of the importance of numbers, accuracy, and strategic decision-making within the corporate landscape.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 2020, an incredible opportunity presented itself when I was granted Luxembourgish citizenship. This pivotal moment marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life. Fuelled by curiosity and a passion for technological innovation, I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a software developer. The ever-evolving world of technology fascinated me, and I couldn't resist the challenge of mastering programming languages, creating innovative solutions, and contributing to the digital transformation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Currently, I'm fully dedicated to expanding my knowledge and honing my skills as a software developer. Through rigorous self-study, hands-on projects, and continuous learning, I am acquiring expertise in various programming languages, software development methodologies, and problem-solving techniques. The dynamic nature of this field inspires me every day, pushing me to embrace new challenges and strive for excellence.</p>
                    
                    <p>On this website, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and creations as I navigate this exciting journey in the realm of software development. Whether you're an aspiring developer, a fellow enthusiast, or a potential collaborator, I invite you to join me on this path of continuous growth and discovery.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find inspiration and value in the content I share. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together!</p>

            <h1>Here are some helpful tips for HTML and CSS to enhance your website:</h1>
            <div class="html">
                <h2>HTML:</h2>
                <img src="Images/html5.png" alt="">

                <ol>
                    <li>Use semantic structure: Employ semantic HTML elements such as header, nav, section, article, footer, etc., to properly structure your website's content. This helps search engines and screen readers understand the organization of your site.</li>
                    <li>Optimize images: Make sure to optimize images for the web by compressing them without compromising too much on quality. This will help improve your site's loading time.</li>
                    <li>Add alt tags to images: Always include an alt attribute in your img tags. This provides an alternative description for images, which is useful for accessibility and helps search engines index your content.</li>
                    <li>Keep code clean: Use proper indentation and comments to make your HTML code more readable and easier to understand for yourself and other developers who may work on your project.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="css">
                <h2>CSS:</h2>
                <img src="Images/css3.png" alt="">

                <ol>
                    <li>Use an external file: Instead of placing CSS styles directly in HTML tags, it's recommended to create an external CSS file and link it to your HTML document. This makes it easier to maintain and reuse styles across multiple pages.</li>
                    <li>Avoid excessive use of inline styles: While it's possible to apply styles directly to HTML tags using the style attribute, try to avoid this whenever possible. It's better to separate content from presentation by using classes and IDs and styling those selectors in your CSS file.</li>
                    <li>Make use of efficient CSS selectors: Learn to use CSS selectors effectively to style specific elements. This includes class selectors (.), ID selectors (#), child selectors (>), descendant selectors (space), attribute selectors ([]), among others.</li>
                    <li>Prioritize responsiveness: Ensure that your website is responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes. Use media queries and flexible layouts to create a responsive design that works on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.</li>
                    <li>Consider accessibility: Keep accessibility in mind when styling your website. Use proper contrast between colors, provide clear visual feedback for interactive elements, ensure text is legible, and make sure your site can be navigated using only the keyboard.</li>
                </ol>

            </div>

            <div class="piscofins">
                <h1>PIS/COFINS</h1>

            <div class="irpj">

            </div>

            <div class="csll">
