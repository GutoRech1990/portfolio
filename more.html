            <h3>My hobbies</h3>
            <img src=Images/hobbies.png alt="hobbies">

            <p>In my free time, I enjoy engaging in various activities that bring me joy and expand my knowledge. Today, I would like to share with you three things that truly make me happy and fulfilled: playing Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Party, exploring Brazilian series, and delving into programming tutorials on YouTube.</p>

            <p>Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Party, and Mario Kart:
            There's something truly magical about the world of Mario, and I find endless delight in playing Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Party, and Mario Kart on my Nintendo Switch. Super Mario Odyssey takes me on an incredible adventure through imaginative and vibrant worlds, while Super Mario Party brings endless fun and excitement with its multiplayer mini-games. And who can resist the exhilarating races and crazy power-ups of Mario Kart? These games provide me with hours of entertainment, allowing me to immerse myself in the beloved universe of Mario and his friends.</p>

            <p>Brazilian Series:
            When I'm not jumping into Mario's world, I love to explore a wide variety of series, with a special preference for Brazilian productions. Brazilian series have been gaining global recognition for their captivating storytelling, unique perspectives, and diverse characters. From the intense crime drama of "Tropa de Elite" to the touching and thought-provoking "3%", Brazilian series offer a rich tapestry of narratives that captivate and entertain. By watching these series, I not only enjoy great storytelling but also support the incredible talent and creativity of Brazilian content creators.</p>

            <p>Programming Tutorials on YouTube:
            In addition to my gaming and series exploration, I am passionate about programming and continuously expanding my knowledge and skills in this field. YouTube has become an invaluable resource for me, as it offers a vast array of programming tutorials and educational content. From beginner-friendly introductions to advanced coding techniques, these tutorials allow me to learn at my own pace and discover new ways to solve problems. I can't emphasize enough how valuable this platform is for me in acquiring new skills and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in programming.</p>

            In addition to my other hobbies, music holds a special place in my life. For me, music is like therapy, capable of transporting me to different states of mind and connecting me with deep emotions. I have a special fondness for Brazilian music as it reflects the cultural richness and diversity of my country. Whether it's samba, bossa nova, MPB, or any other genre, each melody and lyric envelops me in a unique way, providing comfort, joy, and even introspection. Brazilian music is a true soundtrack of my life, and I take pleasure in sharing my musical discoveries and favorite artists with everyone who visits my website.

            <h3>Languages I speak ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Portuguese - mother tongue</li>
                <li>French - B2</li>
                <li>English - B2</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I am a native Portuguese speaker from Brazil, and I am currently on a journey to learn French and English. Learning languages is not always an easy task, but I believe I am making good progress. Currently, I have reached a B2 level in both languages. It has been a rewarding experience to immerse myself in different cultures and expand my linguistic abilities. The process of acquiring new vocabulary, mastering grammar structures, and practicing conversation skills has been both challenging and fulfilling. I am excited to continue my language learning journey and strive for even greater fluency in French and English.</p>
